I got 2 WAs on A and then got an WA on B. This led to frustration and I Stopped doing the contest!
But But But when I saw editorial of both the solutons then I found that I just needed to add one-one condition in both A and B and then I was good to go...
Now I am more frustrated!!! If I did put few more minutes so I could have solved both easily.
Never ever quit and keep trying hard.
